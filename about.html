<p>I am a student at Flatiron School, this is where I'll get my software engineering diploma. I am very ambitious and just riding this wave of life with an antique surfboard from my ancestors from 1000 B.C. I work two jobs and my favorite color is black (even though some say it's not a color). I am a foodie in a sense but if you want to see restaurant  reviews, you'll have to go to my other blog.</p>
