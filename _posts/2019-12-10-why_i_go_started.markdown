Last year, the spring time, I took a free course to become a website developer and the course itself wasn't bad but it wasn't really something I was intresested in. Also at the time I didnt have enough money to complete the entire course. But that's where this started and that's what ignited my fire to get into computer science and preparing for an unknown fate. After my taste of that course, I applied to Lamda and I waited (A LONG TIME) for an acceptance letter that never came (they don't send those out). But I got kind of disenouraged in that time period. I later realized (after life hit me like 10 walls of bricks) I was supposed to go on the website and complete the course prework to be accepted into the program. But by that time I was active in Career Karma and on my way to attending Flatiron School. Who was way more interactive than Lamda or the other UK based school. But they got me on the journey to being able to provide for my family and myself a lot more efficently. Which is something I am very grateful for. And I know this journey to the end is going to be an ordeal but its one that I'll demonstrate resilance, stregnth, integrity and patience. This program to me is a key to unlock so much potiental within myself and to prove to myself that I can do it.
